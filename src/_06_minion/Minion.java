1. 
Run this MinionTest class. Notice the JUnit tab (by the Package Explorer). It shows a RED bar, because the tests do
not run successfully. Check the Failure Trace below that shows "Minion cannot be resolved to a type". 
This is because there is no Minion class in the package.

2.
 So to make these tests pass, you will first need to create a Minion class with the member variables below:

  			private String name; 
  			private int eyes; 
  			private String color; 
  			private String master;

 3.
  Next, create a constructor, and getters and setters for all the member variables of the Minion class. 
  If theyâ€™re done right, all these tests will pass.
  
  To check, run this MinionTest class and the JUnit tab should show a GREEN bar.
